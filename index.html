      <h1>Baby Shower Bingo Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Baby Shower Generator! I ended up hosting a few baby showers for my friends this year and had to come up with games! There were a few free sites that had baby shower themes but they didn't fit my needs.
        </br>
        Instructions
        </br>
        (1) I have included a generated word list for the baby shower, but you are able to make edits to it to add other baby shower related words.
        <br>
        (2) You can generate calling cards
        <br>
        (3) Generate the Bingo cards.
        <br>
        I hope you found this site helpful.
